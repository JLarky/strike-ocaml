## What is this?

This is an experimental version of Strike framework (React Server Components framework with Go backend) but it uses OCaml instad of Go on the backend.

See [Strike](https://github.com/JLarky/strike)

## How to run

First of all, I have no idea how to use ocaml :)

Try [this](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running) to get ocaml installed.

Once you have it you can do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JLarky/strike-ocaml.git
cd strike-ocaml
# dune install
# dune build
dune exec ./bin/main.exe -w
```
